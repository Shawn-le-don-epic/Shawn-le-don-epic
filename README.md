- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shawn-le-don-epic
- 👀 I’m interested in Quantum Computing, but I remain a fan, and not an expert :(
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (beyond OOPS, into other lovely quirks of the language-I'll be hitting Springboot soon, now that I have learnt to connect Java and PostgreSQL)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtually anything code, but my preferences are Java projects, backend (PostgreSQL), and Python projects.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Outside code, I am the most retro person you will ever com across!
